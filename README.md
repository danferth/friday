Friday Countdown Clock
======================

Small PHP page that displays a countdown timer to fridays 5:30 PST

**Things that need to be completed**

<strike>- finish up function for easier implimentation later</strike>
<strike>- have it auto refresh so actually countdowns (*JS possibly*)</strike>
- Add help (?) icon for problems ie tell people to refresh browser if timer stops
- favicon
- maybe closing animation for zero time
- add analytics
